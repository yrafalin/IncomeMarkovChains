# IncomeMarkovChains

Miles was my partner during this project. We analyzed quintile mobility and population distribution stability over generations.

* transitions_inequality.py: imports the data from csv
* transition_moves.py: simulates moving between quintiles to find avg # of generations
* races_over_gens.py: prints the new population distributions of races until reaching stable point
